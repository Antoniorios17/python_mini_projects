# Conditional Statements

# All flow control tools involve evaluating a condition statement
#most common one is == 

#==
# we use it to compare if two variables are the same
# example
# x == y
# you are asking the program to check if the value of x is equal to y
#if the condition is met then the statement will be "True"
# else the statement will be "False"

# not equal !=
5 != 2

#greater than >
5 > 2

# smaller than <
5 < 2

# greater than or equal to:
5 >= 2
4 >= 4

# smaller than or equal to:
2 <= 2
3 <= 5

# we also have logical operators
# and , or, not

# and
# and will return True is all conditions are true
5==5 and 2>1

# or 
# or will operator returns True if at least one condition is met
5 > 2 or 7 > 10 or 3 == 2

# not
# not operator returns True if the condition after the not keyword is false
# else it will return false

# the statement 
not 2 > 5 
#will return True since 2 is not greater than 5
